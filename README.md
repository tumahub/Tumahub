## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science Student with a strong background in engineering and laser technology. After years of hands-on experience as a laser technician, I'm now diving into the world of programming, algorithms, and software development. My technical foundation in precision engineering and problem-solving fuels my passion for building innovative software solutions. Whether it's coding a new project or tinkering with hardware, I love turning ideas into reality.

ðŸŒŸ Currently: Pursuing a degree in Computer Science, focusing on [e.g., software development, algorithms, or machine learning].
ðŸŒ± Learning: Data structures, web development, and [specific CS areas, e.g., AI, cybersecurity, or embedded systems].  
ðŸ’¡ Fun Fact: I once calibrated a laser system to micron-level precision and now I'm debugging code with the same attention to detail!
